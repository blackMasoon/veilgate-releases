# CLI reference

The `veilgate` binary exposes several subcommands:

- `veilgate serve` – start the gateway and admin servers.
- `veilgate validate-config` – validate the configuration file and exit.
- `veilgate mcp init` – scaffold a new MCP server backed by Veilgate.

This section will be extended as additional commands and flags are added,
including the documentation export command used by the docs pipeline.
