# Veilgate – overview

Veilgate is a single-binary, high‑performance HTTP API gateway with:

- **Gateway** – configurable reverse proxy with routing, auth, rate limiting and DDoS guardrails.
- **Admin server & dashboard** – JSON admin API plus a built‑in React dashboard for operators.
- **MCP integration** – first‑class support for exposing HTTP APIs as MCP tools for LLM agents.

Veilgate focuses on:

- **Performance** – low additional latency vs talking directly to upstreams.
- **Simplicity** – configuration‑first, minimal moving parts.
- **Extensibility** – composable middleware, policies and MCP tools.
- **Operability** – metrics, health checks, rich admin API and dashboard.
